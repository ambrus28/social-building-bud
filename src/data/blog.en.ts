Hiking is more sensitive, because terrain matters too, not just comfort, a muddy, slippery trail carries a different risk than a city sidewalk. Outdoor yoga and casual walking groups are the most weather-sensitive of all, because the outdoor experience itself is the whole point, which is hard to replicate in the rain.",
