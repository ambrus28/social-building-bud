      "A list of Budapest sports clubs: running clubs, casual football, cycling, pickleball and tennis. Beginner-friendly groups with times and links, no sign-up needed.",
    intro: [
      "Most sports communities in Budapest aren't formal clubs, they're groups of friends who meet at the same spot once a week. That's exactly why they're hard to find: no website, just an Instagram account, and they rarely advertise anywhere.",
      "Every group listed here is real and active, and most are open to you showing up alone. If you've never done this before, running clubs and outdoor basketball are the easiest way in, because nobody expects you to sign up ahead of time. This list is hand-curated and kept up to date by Budapesti Közösségek.",

      "Where to practise languages in Budapest: weekly language exchange nights, a Hungarian conversation club and social meetups for expats. Times, venues and links.",
    intro: [
      "Language exchange events work well as a first community because everyone shows up with the same intention: talking to strangers. You don't need to break into an existing group, the format itself does that work for you.",
      "The communities listed here typically meet weekly and don't require advance registration. You can show up regardless of your language level, since most venues set up separate tables for different languages and levels. This list is hand-curated and kept up to date by Budapesti Közösségek.",

      "Group hikes in the hills around Budapest, guided trips for every level. A free list of real hiking communities.",
    intro: [
      "Hiking is one of the easiest ways to join a group alone. It lasts for hours, there's always something to walk toward and talk about, and nobody notices if you're quiet for the first thirty minutes.",
      "The communities here set out from Budapest, usually to spots reachable by public transport, and most clearly mark which hikes are beginner-friendly. This list is hand-curated and kept up to date by Budapesti Közösségek.",

    intro: [
      "Making friends as an adult is harder than anyone admits, and women's communities exist precisely to fill that gap: they're built around connection first, not necessarily around a specific activity.",
      "The groups listed here run in different formats, from group walks to organized conversation evenings. If you're unsure where to start, walks are the easiest entry point: there's no icebreaker round, you just start moving together.

    intro: [
      "Board game nights are an unusually good entry point because the game itself gives you the structure, so you don't have to start a conversation, you just have to sit at a table. One round in, you've met three or four people without trying.",
      "Most communities here are free or just expect you to buy something at the venue, and there's almost always someone happy to explain the rules. You don't need to bring your own game. This list is hand-curated and kept up to date by Budapesti Közösségek.",

    intro: [
      "A book club differs from most communities in one key way: you know exactly what you'll be talking about in advance. For a lot of people, that's the safety net that makes showing up for the first time possible at all.",
      "The clubs listed here typically meet once a month and announce the next book ahead of time. If you fell behind on the reading, you can still come, and most clubs say so explicitly. This list is hand-curated and kept up to date by Budapesti Közösségek.",

      "No prior experience is needed for the communities here, and outdoor sessions usually require nothing but your own mat. Several are paired with alcohol-free social events. This list is hand-curated and kept up to date by Budapesti Közösségek.",

    intro: [
      "Many people avoid trying a meditation group because they assume it means joining some kind of organization. Most of the communities listed here go out of their way to say the opposite: they're independent.",

    intro: [
      "The whole point of social dance is that you're not supposed to arrive as a couple: you rotate partners on the floor, and that's exactly what makes it a community rather than a date night. Showing up alone isn't awkward, it's the norm.",
